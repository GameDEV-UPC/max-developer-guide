# Introduction

Welcome to the Max developer guide! You can read it in a linear fashion or use
it as a quick reference. You can use the left sidebar menu to navigate the
different pages or the search button if you're looking for anything specific.

This documentation is maintained by us, so if anything is out of date let us
know! You can click on the *suggest an edit* button on the top right corner
to open an issue on github. Alternatively, you can tell us directly.
